"""
This subpackage contains functions that make it convenient to plot certain types of
graphs.

Figures of publication quality usually require a lot of fine tuning. The functions in
this subpackage are not meant to have all the different features to be able to make
figures of that quality. Instead, these functions make it easy to create certain kinds
of common plots very quickly.
