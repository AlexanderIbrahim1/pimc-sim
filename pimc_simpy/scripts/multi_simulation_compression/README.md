For the N = 180, P = 960 simulations, I ran 1000 separate simulations, each performing a single block
  - about 980 of those simulations were completed

This is an annoying format to work with
  - I need to combine the data from all the 1000 separate simulations into the same format as
    if all the blocks were performed in a single simulation
  - this will make it easier for the existing code to analyze the data
