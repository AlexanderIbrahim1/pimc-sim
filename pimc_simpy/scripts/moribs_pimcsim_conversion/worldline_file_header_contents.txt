# This file contains the positions of all the beads in all the particles in a simulation
# The information after the comments is laid out in the following manner:
# - [integer] block index of the simulation this snapshot is taken at
# - [integer] NDIM: number of dimensions the simulation was performed in
# - [integer] n_particles: total number of particles
# - [integer] n_timeslices: total number of timeslices
# ... followed by the bead positions...
# 
# The positions of the beads are laid out in `NDIM` space-separated columns;
#   - the first `n_particle` lines correspond to the 0th worldline
#   - the next `n_particle` lines correspond to the 1st worldline
#   - the next `n_particle` lines correspond to the 2nd worldline, and so on
#   - there are `n_timeslices` worldlines in total
