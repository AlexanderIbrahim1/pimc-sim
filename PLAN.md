# Plan for PIMC-SIM

## Goal
The goal of this project is to simulate solid parahydrogen with many-body interaction potentials

- I should be able to create pointwise molecules
  - but it should be flexible enough to create more molecules in general
- I should suppose distance functions both with and without periodicity
- I should have separate sections of code for sampling and estimation
- I should have a way to collect information from a TOML file, to support simulations with different parameters
