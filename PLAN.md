# Plan for PIMC-SIM

## Goal
The goal of this project is to simulate solid parahydrogen with many-body interaction potentials

- I should be able to create pointwise molecules
  - but it should be flexible enough to create more molecules in general
- I should suppose distance functions both with and without periodicity
- I should have separate sections of code for sampling and estimation
- I should have a way to collect information from a TOML file, to support simulations with different parameters


## Particles
The simulation's performance is mostly bound by its ability to calculate interaction potentials
- interaction potentials are only calculated between particles on the same worldline
- this implies that, for cache optimization, the beads should be worldline-contiguous, not particle-contiguous

### Worldline-contiguity
+ better cache layout (points are closer to each other in memory)
+ probably easier to go from the classical case (1 bead) to the quantum case (many beads)
  + because the classical case is just a single worldline

- code becomes more complicated if there is more than a single variety of particle

### Particle-contiguity
+ simpler to implement in general
+ more intuitive to think about

- worse cache locality, worse performance for large systems


## PRNG
I need a random number generator that I can pass into functions
- I can use the Mersenne Twister for now, maybe switch to a faster one in the future


## Interaction Handlers
I need some sort of function that deals with calculating interactions between particles in the system
There could be several; I'll need a different one for different MC moves

For example:
- consider an object that calculates the interaction potential energy experienced by a single bead
  - it holds all the different interaction potentials
  - it will accept the index of the bead of interest, and all the worldlines
  - it will calculate the interaction potential experienced by just that bead
